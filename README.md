# 🎵 Cameron's Virtual Vinyl Wall  

This is my **personal digital music space**, inspired by vinyl walls and old-school record players.  
I wanted a place online where I could **showcase my favorite albums**, spin them like real records,  
and pair the experience with **lyrics, playback controls, and custom animations**.  

It’s part portfolio project, part creative archive.

## ✨ Current Features
- 📀 Spinning vinyl animation with album art in the center.  
- 🎤 Lyrics panel that scrolls with timestamped lines.  
- ⏯️ Playback controls at the bottom (Play/Pause, Next, Shuffle).  
- 🖼️ Song info (title, artist, album, year) displayed neatly under the vinyl.  
- ⚡ Responsive layout (side-by-side player + lyrics on desktop, stacked on mobile).

## 🚀 Future Goals
This project is a **work-in-progress**, with a roadmap for new features:
- 🔗 **Spotify API Integration** – play full tracks with my Premium account, or previews for visitors.  
- 🌀 **Smarter Animations** – vinyl spin speed synced with playback state (pause, resume, fast-forward).  
- 🎛️ **Album Grid Wall** – browse all my favorite albums like a digital shelf.  
- 📡 **Raspberry Pi Expansion** – RFID-tagged album cards that trigger playback when tapped.  
- 🎚️ Filters & Playlists – sort albums by genre, mood, or decade.

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- **HTML5** – structure of the player  
- **CSS3** – vinyl animations, responsive design  
- **JavaScript (planned)** – dynamic updates & Spotify API integration  
- **Spotify API (future)** – music data + playback  
- **Raspberry Pi + RFID (future)** – physical interaction layer

## 🙌 Why I Built This
I grew up loving music and collecting vinyl aesthetics, so I wanted to merge that with web design.  
This project is as much a **portfolio experiment** in interactive UI as it is my **digital music archive**.
